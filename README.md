# GPT-based-AI-bot-integrated-with-Oodoo
GPT-based AI bot integrated with Odoo. This bot will provide data insights and summaries, learning from interactions over time. Accessible as a mobile-responsive web app, the bot will integrate seamlessly with Odoo, offering users a ChatGPT-like experience that adapts and improves with continuous training and input from SMEtools.

Responsibilities:
Mobile-Responsive Web App & Odoo Integration: Design the AI bot as a mobile-responsive web app accessible through the Odoo app store. Users will connect their Odoo accounts via the Bubble platform for data access without creating or modifying records within Odoo.

Data Retrieval and Adaptive Learning: Configure the bot to fetch data tables from Odoo (e.g., sales orders, stock moves, journal items), analyze them, and deliver insights. The bot will learn from user interactions, remembering key details and preferences over time for more tailored responses.

Conversational Interface with Memory: Develop a ChatGPT-inspired UI/UX that supports voice and text input. Ensure the bot can retain important details from past conversations to enhance user experience and provide continuity across sessions.

Owner-Controlled Continuous Training: Enable SMEtools to view past conversations and update the bot with new training data regularly. This will involve a user-friendly interface for SMEtools to input new knowledge, including relevant web-sourced information, and to refine the bot’s responses based on historical conversations.

SaaS Subscription & Credit System: Implement a SaaS model where clients are billed based on credits, reflecting their usage and data sync requirements. Provide clear metrics for clients to track their subscription and credit usage.

Scalability for Future Integrations: Build a modular structure that allows for future integration with additional platforms beyond Odoo, such as Google Sheets, Slack, and Shopify, as business needs evolve.

Requirements:
Experience with Bubble for no-code development, with mobile-responsive design expertise
Strong understanding of Odoo’s API for secure data fetching, particularly for read-only data access
Expertise in conversational AI, especially in developing interfaces with memory and adaptive learning capabilities
Ability to design an owner-accessible training dashboard for continuous learning and historical conversation review
Familiarity with SaaS credit-based pricing and subscription models
This role is ideal for a team skilled in creating AI-driven, adaptive tools that blend ERP insights with advanced UX. By offering a continually improving data experience, this bot will help clients leverage their Odoo data while allowing SMEtools to oversee and enhance its capabilities over time.

Creating a GPT-based AI bot integrated with Odoo is a multifaceted project that requires expertise in various technologies. Below is a structured overview and sample Python code to help you conceptualize and implement key features of this bot.
Project Overview
Key Components

    Mobile-Responsive Web App: Developed using a no-code platform like Bubble, with a backend in Python for AI logic.
    Odoo Integration: Utilize Odoo’s API to fetch data securely.
    Conversational Interface: Implement a ChatGPT-like interface with memory capabilities.
    Owner-Controlled Training: Allow SMEtools to refine the bot’s responses and learn from user interactions.
    SaaS Subscription Model: Implement a credit system for billing based on usage.

Sample Python Code

Below is a simplified example demonstrating how to set up a basic server using Flask to handle user requests and interact with Odoo.
Step 1: Set Up Flask Server

Install Flask and necessary libraries:

bash

pip install Flask requests openai

Step 2: Create the Flask App

Here’s a basic structure for your Flask application:

python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests
import openai

app = Flask(__name__)

# Odoo configuration
ODOO_URL = 'https://your-odoo-instance.com'
ODOO_DB = 'your_db_name'
ODOO_USER = 'your_email'
ODOO_PASSWORD = 'your_password'

# OpenAI configuration
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Function to authenticate and get Odoo access token
def odoo_auth():
    url = f"{ODOO_URL}/api/authentication"
    response = requests.post(url, json={
        'db': ODOO_DB,
        'login': ODOO_USER,
        'password': ODOO_PASSWORD
    })
    return response.json().get('access_token')

# Function to fetch data from Odoo
def fetch_odoo_data(model_name):
    access_token = odoo_auth()
    url = f"{ODOO_URL}/api/v1/{model_name}"
    headers = {'Authorization': f"Bearer {access_token}"}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Endpoint for chat interactions
@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_input = request.json.get('message')
    
    # Fetch data from Odoo (example: sales orders)
    odoo_data = fetch_odoo_data('sale.order')

    # Process the input with OpenAI's API
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": user_input},
            {"role": "system", "content": f"Here is the Odoo data: {odoo_data}"}
        ]
    )

    bot_response = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    return jsonify({'response': bot_response})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of the Code

    Odoo Authentication: The odoo_auth() function retrieves an access token for secure API calls to Odoo.
    Fetch Data from Odoo: The fetch_odoo_data() function calls the Odoo API to retrieve data from specified models (e.g., sales orders).
    Chat Endpoint: The /chat route accepts POST requests containing user messages. It fetches relevant Odoo data and processes user input through OpenAI's API to generate a response.

Next Steps

    Mobile-Responsive Frontend: Use Bubble to create a user-friendly interface that connects to this backend.
    Memory and Adaptive Learning: Implement logic to store and retrieve past interactions. This could involve a database to maintain conversation history and user preferences.
    Training Dashboard: Create an interface for SMEtools to input new data and review past interactions. You could implement a simple form to capture training data.
    Subscription Model: Integrate a billing system to track user credits based on API calls and interactions.
    Future Integrations: Design the architecture to easily integrate with other platforms (Google Sheets, Slack, etc.) as needed.

Final Thoughts

This framework provides a starting point for building a sophisticated AI bot integrated with Odoo. Ensure to test each component thoroughly and adhere to best practices in API usage, data handling, and user privacy.
